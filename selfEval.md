# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I'm feeling pretty good about objects. I didn't struggle much with this section.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

For this section, I took notes on proper formatting for objects, and all the individual commands (correct term?) for adding new key-value pairs, modifying values of keys, printing all the keys in an object, etc. When I learn something that feels like it won't be easy to remember off the top of my head for a while, I write it on a sticky note and stick it to my wall near my desk. I didn't do that with anything from this lesson, because I feel like the syntax for the things we covered here are pretty intuitive. That being said, I have my notebook notes to fall back on if I do forget something.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I'm really not a fan of Googling/searching through Stack Overflow until I know I have to. I'm prone to fall down rabbit holes and burn a lot of time when I Google around, even if I do inadvertently end up learning other things. I like tinkering with the code myself, if it feels like something I can fix on my own. I think I'm better at retaining the lessons learned from fixing issues myself as well.
